    contribute to the Commons to promote
    the ideal of a free culture and the further
    production of creative, cultural and
    scientific works, or to gain reputation
    or greater distribution for their Work
    in part through the use and efforts of
    others.
  </p>
  <p>For these and/or other purposes and motivations,
    and without any expectation of additional
    consideration or compensation, the person
    associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"),
    to the extent that he or she is an owner
    of Copyright and Related Rights in the
    Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0
    to the Work and publicly distribute the
    Work under its terms, with knowledge
    of his or her Copyright and Related Rights
    in the Work and the meaning and intended
    legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
  </p>
  <p><strong>1. Copyright and Related Rights.</strong>
    A Work made available under CC0 may be
    protected by copyright and related or
    neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related
    Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights
    include, but are not limited to, the
    following:
  </p>
  <ol type="i">
    <li>the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute,
      perform, display, communicate, and
      translate a Work;
    </li>
    <li> moral rights retained by the original
      author(s) and/or performer(s);
    </li>
    <li>publicity and privacy rights pertaining
      to a person's image or likeness depicted
      in a Work;
    </li>
    <li>rights protecting against unfair competition
      in regards to a Work, subject to the
      limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
    </li>
    <li>rights protecting the extraction, dissemination,
      use and reuse of data in a Work;
    </li>
    <li>database rights (such as those arising
      under Directive 96/9/EC of the European
      Parliament and of the Council of 11
      March 1996 on the legal protection
      of databases, and under any national
      implementation thereof, including any
      amended or successor version of such
      directive); and
    </li>
    <li>other similar, equivalent or corresponding
      rights throughout the world based on
      applicable law or treaty, and any national
      implementations thereof.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>2. Waiver.</strong> To the greatest
    extent permitted by, but not in contravention
    of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly,
    fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally
    waives, abandons, and surrenders all
    of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights
    and associated claims and causes of action,
    whether now known or unknown (including
    existing as well as future claims and
    causes of action), in the Work (i) in
    all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
    maximum duration provided by applicable
    law or treaty (including future time
    extensions), (iii) in any current or
    future medium and for any number of copies,
    and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
    including without limitation commercial,
    advertising or promotional purposes (the
    "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver
    for the benefit of each member of the
    public at large and to the detriment
    of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully
    intending that such Waiver shall not
    be subject to revocation, rescission,
    cancellation, termination, or any other
    legal or equitable action to disrupt
    the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the
    public as contemplated by Affirmer's
    express Statement of Purpose.
  </p>
  <p><strong>3. Public License Fallback.</strong>
    Should any part of the Waiver for any
    reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective
    under applicable law, then the Waiver
    shall be preserved to the maximum extent
    permitted taking into account Affirmer's
    express Statement of Purpose. In addition,
    to the extent the Waiver is so judged
    Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
    person a royalty-free, non transferable,
    non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable
    and unconditional license to exercise
    Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights
    in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide,
    (ii) for the maximum duration provided
    by applicable law or treaty (including
    future time extensions), (iii) in any
    current or future medium and for any
    number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose
    whatsoever, including without limitation
    commercial, advertising or promotional
    purposes (the "License"). The License
    shall be deemed effective as of the date
    CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work.
    Should any part of the License for any
    reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective
    under applicable law, such partial invalidity
    or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate
    the remainder of the License, and in
    such case Affirmer hereby affirms that
    he or she will not (i) exercise any of
    his or her remaining Copyright and Related
    Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any
    associated claims and causes of action
    with respect to the Work, in either case
    contrary to Affirmer's express Statement
    of Purpose.
  </p>
  <p><strong>4. Limitations and Disclaimers.</strong>
